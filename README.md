# gulp-wireframe
**a simple template for a simple project.**

gulp-wireframe exists to help make my build process a little easier. The file structure, packages, and styles are all just a personal preference.

### instructions
    - git clone https://github.com/Zafuzi/gulp-wireframe
    - cd gulp-wireframe
    - npm install
    - npm run build / gulp build
    - npm run serve / gulp prod

### notes
    If you are an employer, this is a good example of how I begin a project. Otherwise if you do happen to come across this repo by chance and have some advice, please let me know.
